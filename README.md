## About Our Project

Welcome to Travel Hacker!
Our project would center on traveling. The idea of the website is to revolve around having different components to help your travel be effortless from start to finish. Our company has narrowed down the basics to our traveling website. Including, exchange rate, news/events trending, lodge (our focus on Airbnb), and the latest statistics on your flight information. Our mission is to absolve this part of your trip and have you worry about the things that deserve more of your attention.\
